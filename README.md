# Random Forest for Time Series Variable Selection

This project was done as part of the Machine Learning class within my BS program at UCSB. It investigates the research presented by Hristos Tyralis and Georgia Papacharalampous petaining to the use of Random Forest machine learning models as a mechanism for forecasting in comparison to contemporary methods such as auto.arima and ACF/PACF analysis.
